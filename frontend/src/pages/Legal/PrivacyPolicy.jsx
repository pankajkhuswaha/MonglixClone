          our website continually. If you have any recommendations or encounter
          accessibility issues while using our site, please let us know. Your

        <h1>Compliance</h1>
        <p>
          We are actively working to ensure that our website complies with
          applicable accessibility standards and guidelines. Accessibility is an
          ongoing commitment, and we are dedicated to maintaining and improving
          our website's accessibility for all users.

        <h1>Third-Party Content</h1>
        <p>
          While we strive to ensure our website is accessible, there may be
          third-party content or links to external websites that are beyond our
          control. We cannot guarantee the accessibility of such content but
          encourage you to contact us if you encounter accessibility issues
          related to third-party content.
        </p>
        <h1>Embedded content from other websites</h1>
        <p>
          Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos,
          images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves
          in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
          These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
          additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
          that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
          embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
          website.

        <h1>How long we retain your data</h1>
        <p>
          If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
          indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
          comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
          For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
          personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can
          see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except
          they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also
          see and edit that information.

        <p>
          If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can
          request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
          you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
          that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
          include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or
          security purposes.
